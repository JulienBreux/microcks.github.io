			<p>
			As stated by the name, this feature allows you to simply export to a JSON file a part or a whole Microcks repository. By repository we mean, all your Micro-services definitions, their operations and request / response samples. Import jobs or tests are not exportable. Exporting and then re-importing repository allows you for example, to quickly set-up a new environment with potentially different response times settings (see below) for dedicated usage such as performance validation or user-acceptance tests.
			</p>

			<p>
			The export feature is reachable using the <code>Administration > Export repository</code> entry into the top menu bar has shown below. It needs no specific privileges.
			</p>

			<p>
			The list of your Micro-services / version pairs is then displayed and you just need to select the target services before hitting the <code>Export</code> button.
			</p>

			<p>
			Export is then created and made available as a <code>microcks-repository.json</code> file being downloaded. This file is ready to be imported into another Microcks instance.
