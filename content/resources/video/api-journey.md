As API are now becoming mainstream, a lot of focus is put on development and API Gateways. However, this does not solve all the problems… People are still facing issues regarding versioning, pragmatic usage of contract-first approaches or governance! In order to be truly efficient delivering API, it’s the whole lifecycle that needs to be considered. In this hands-on lab, we’ll go through Red Hat’s approach for API development. You will experiment how to: use mocking to speed-up and break dependencies, use contract-first approach for defining tests that will harden your implementation, protect exposed API through a management gateway and finally secure deliveries using CI/CD pipeline. You will learn how Red Hat products and sponsored upstream projects like 3scale, Apicurio and Microcks can augment the OpenShift platform to provide your new API Factory foundations.
