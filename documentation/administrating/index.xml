      <description>Introduction Since its inception, Microcks relies on a third party component named Keycloak for managing security related topics like users identification, users authentication and habilitations as well as API endpoints protection. Keycloak is also used for providing service accounts authentication and authorization. This topic is detailed in a dedicated page.
Basic installation of Microcks (through Kubernetes Operator, Helm Chart, OpenShift template or Docker-compose) comes with its own Keycloak instance embedding the definitions of Microcks needed component into what is called a realm.</description>

      <description>Introduction Starting with Microcks version 0.7.0, we add the ability to manage some forms of Secrets in order to access private HTTP(S) repositories su as Git ones.
Secrets can only be managed by Microcks administrator - we mean people having the administrator role assigned. If you need further information on how to manage users and roles, please check here. Secrets management is simply a thumbnail with the Administration page that is available from the vertical menu on the left once logged in as administrator.</description>
