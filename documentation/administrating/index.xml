      <description>Introduction Starting with Microcks version 0.8.0, we add the ability to partially manage users directly from the Microcks GUI. &amp;ldquo;Partially&amp;rdquo; means that you are able to manage a user&amp;rsquo;s roles within Microcks application but not able to create a new user. This action is reserved to your Identity Provider used through Keycloak configuration or to Keycloak itself if you choose to use it as a provider.
Users can only be managed by Microcks administrator - we mean people having the administrator role assigned.</description>

      <description>Introduction Starting with Microcks version 0.7.0, we add the ability to manage some forms of Secrets in order to access private HTTP(S) repositories su as Git ones.
Secrets can only be managed by Microcks administrator - we mean people having the administrator role assigned. If you need further information on how to manage users and roles, please check here. Secrets management is simply a thumbnail with the Administration page that is available from the vertical menu on the left once logged in as administrator.</description>
